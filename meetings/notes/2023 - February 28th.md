SIG Release Meeting - February 28 2023

- Roadmaps
	* We have had new roadmaps released for SIGs in the last few monthly TSC meetings, focus is now on keeping them up to date periodically.
	* We intend to make the roadmaps easier to find, possibly in the docs website. Possibly a landing page, or all collected in a single repo that is easily discoverable. Discussion is going on.
	> vincentvincent has been working on these roadmap tasks and increasing the awareness, before passing everything to the marketing team.

- New release
	Next release is scheduled for May 3rd, the stabilization branch will be cut in a couple weeks (March 15).
	(There has been talks about increasing the number of releases per year, or using a different process with alpha, beta, RC states, but it's still being talked about as it would require changes to process management)
	Release manager will be a Linux Foundation PM that is slated to be onboarded soon.

- Discussion about O3DExtras and Canonical repos
	*	Canonical repos should be included in the release.
	*	O3DExtras will be included in the next release. Additional repos will be evaluated in the future.
	*	The SIG's approach right now is to "test drive" the release process with O3DExtras, even if it may not be included in the downloadable package/installer, to gather data and knowledge in order to assess the best way to organize the release process in the postmortem.

- Follow-ups about including O3DExtras in the release
	> Tony B to follow-up with SIGs to ensure that it is known that the stabilization process will also include the O3DExtras repo in the same way as the main repo.
	
	* Automated Testing with canonical repos may work differently for the O3DExtras repo.
	> Danilo to reach out to Mike Chang to clarify if our current process needs adjustments.
	
	* Merging process with canonical repos - current merge process from stabilization branch to development does not include O3DExtras, so the guides will have to be updated to include it. We also may want to start opening up the whole process to the community, since historically it was run by Amazon maintainers.
	
	* Release notes process may have to be adapted, because O3DExtras contains multiple, individual Gems that could be downloaded independently from the Project Manager. As such, their release notes may have to live in different places compared to the main O3DE docs.
	> Will need to follow up with sig-docs-community and bring up the issue for the upcoming release.
	
- Release notes steamlining process
	* No progress, this release will still use the manual note-taking process. Will try to kickstart automations in the repo so that they are ready for the next release.
	> Danilo to reach out to Mike Chang and figure out how to set up a GitHub bot for stabilization process (which could be used during this release process) and release notes (for the next release).
